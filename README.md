# textClusteringDBSCAN : Clustering text using Density Based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN) using TF-IDF, FastText word vectors and other combined approaches

## NOTE: This is an improved library for clustering text. For original repository, please pull to the 'original' branch of this code. All further changes will be default, as a part of the change plan. 

### The following functionalities are being added to this code (estimated completion by 10/01/2020):
- Add support for performing clustering on csv files. 
- Ability to save cluster characteristic file for real time cluster inference boosting.
- Add TFIDF support for large datasets.
- Add cluster visualization and metrics in plotly.
- Add FastText word vector based DBSCAN computation.
- Validation on real dataset (csv)
- Available as a Python repository and installable via pip

Introduction
-------------
This is a library for performing unsupervised lingustic functionalities based on textual fields on your data. An API will also be released for real-time inference. This is a small part of project fling, which is an opensource linguistic library designed for easy integration to applications.
