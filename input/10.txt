Malhotra was born in Delhi to Sunil, a former employee of the Indian Merchant Navy, and Rimmi Malhotra, a homemaker.[4] He was schooled at Delhi's Don Bosco School and Naval Public School, and later attended Shaheed Bhagat Singh College.[5] At the age of 18, Malhotra began modelling. Although he was successful, he decided to quit after four years because he was dissatisfied with the profession.[6] Interested to pursue an acting career, he successfully auditioned for a film to be directed by Anubhav Sinha. However, the film was shelved, following which he worked as an assistant director to Karan Johar on the 2010 film My Name Is Khan.[5][7]

Acting career[edit]
In 2012, Malhotra made his acting debut with Johar's Student of the Year alongside Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt. He was cast as Abhimanyu Singh, a scholarship student of limited financial means, who competes with his wealthy best friend Rohan (played by Dhawan) to win an annual school championship. Film critic Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN considered Malhotra's performance to be "earnest", adding that he had "a pleasing presence."[8] Student of the Year was a financial success,[9] grossing ?700 million (US$10 million) domestically.[10]

Malhotra was next paired opposite Parineeti Chopra and Adah Sharma for the romantic comedy Hasee Toh Phasee (2014), which tells the love story of a drug-abusing scientist and an under-confident aspiring businessman. Mohar Basu of Koimoi found his performance to be "restrained" and described his chemistry with Chopra as "lively" and "heartfelt"; Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV praised his screen presence and compared it to the early work of Amitabh Bachchan.[11][12] The film performed moderately well at the box office, with global revenues of ?620 million (US$9.3 million).[13] His second release in 2014 was the Mohit Suri-directed romantic thriller Ek Villain. Malhotra was cast as Guru, a hardened criminal whose terminally-ill wife (played by Shraddha Kapoor) is murdered by a serial killer (played by Riteish Deshmukh). Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express reviewed: "Sidharth Malhotra is watchable even if he has a hard time doing menace — he just seems so nice and wholesome all the time, even when he is crunching bones."[14] The film was generally perceived to be plagiarised from the Korean film I Saw the Devil, although Suri dismissed the allegations.[15] The film eventually emerged as a major commercial success with domestic revenues of over ?1 billion (US$15 million).[16] The box office performance of the film established Malhotra as one of the most successful among the new generation of Bollywood actors.[17][18]

In 2015, Malhotra appeared in the remake of the Hollywood film Warrior (2011), entitled Brothers, directed by Karan Malhotra and co-starring Akshay Kumar, Jacqueline Fernandez and Jackie Shroff.[19][20] The film became a commercial success.[21]
