Diego Armando Maradona Franco (Spanish pronunciation: ['dje?o ma?a'ðona], born 30 October 1960) is a retired Argentine professional footballer. He has served as a manager and coach at other clubs as well as the national team of Argentina. Many experts, football critics, former players, current players and football fans regard Maradona as the greatest football player of all time.[5][6][7][8] He was joint FIFA Player of the 20th Century with Pelé.[9][10]

An advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position, Maradona is the only player in football history to set the world record transfer fee twice, first when he transferred to Barcelona for a then world record £5m, and second, when he transferred to Napoli for another record fee £6.9m.[11] He played for Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla and Newell's Old Boys during his club career, and is most famous for his time at Napoli where he won numerous accolades. In his international career with Argentina, he earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals. Maradona's exceptional vision, passing, ball control, dribbling skills, speed, reflexes and thinking time was combined with his small size (he was 5'5", or 1.65m) giving him a low center of gravity which allowed him to be more maneuverable than most other football players; he would often dribble past multiple opposing players on a run. His presence on the pitch would have a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "El Pibe de Oro" ("The Golden Boy"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career.[12]

Maradona played in four FIFA World Cups, including the 1986 World Cup in Mexico where he captained Argentina and led them to victory over West Germany in the final, and won the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player. In the 1986 World Cup quarter final, he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over England that entered football history for two different reasons. The first goal was an unpenalized handling foul known as the "Hand of God", while the second goal followed a 60 m (66 yd) dribble past five England players, voted "The Goal of the Century" by FIFA.com voters in 2002.[13]

Maradona became coach of Argentina in November 2008. He was in charge of the team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa before leaving at the end of the tournament. He coached Dubai-based club Al Wasl in the UAE Pro-League for the 2011–12 season. In August 2013, Maradona joined Argentine Primera D club Deportivo Riestra's staff as "spiritual coach,Diego Maradona was born on 30 October 1960, at the Policlínico (Polyclinic) Evita Hospital in Lanús, Buenos Aires Province, but raised in Villa Fiorito, a shantytown on the southern outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina,[16] to a poor family that had moved from Corrientes Province. He was the first son after three daughters. He has two younger brothers, Hugo (el Turco) and Raúl (Lalo), both of whom were also professional football players. Maradona is of Italian, Spanish, Croatian, Indigenous-Argentinian ancestry.[17][18] His surname originates from the Spanish region Galicia.[17][19][20]

He was the fifth child and first son of Diego Maradona 'Chitoro' and Dalma Salvadora Franco 'Doña Tota' (1930–2011). Both his parents were illegitimate children. His father took the family name of his mother because his father did not recognise him as his own. Maradona's mother was not recognised by her father, Atanancio Ramón Edisto Franco, until she was eighteen years old. Maradona's parents were both born and brought up in the town of Esquina in the north-east province of Corrientes Province, living only two hundred yards from each other on the banks of the Corriente River. In 1950, they left Esquina and settled in Buenos Aires. At age eight, Maradona was spotted by a talent scout while he was playing in his neighbourhood club Estrella Roja. He became a staple of Los Cebollitas (The Little Onions), the junior team of Buenos Aires's Argentinos Juniors. As a 12-year-old ball boy, he amused spectators by showing his wizardry with the ball during the halftime intermissions of first division games.[21] He named Brazilian playmaker Rivelino and Manchester United winger George Best among his inspirations growing up.On 20 October 1976, Maradona made his professional debut for Argentinos Juniors, ten days before his sixteenth birthday.[24] He entered to the pitch wearing the number 16 jersey, and after the game stated: "That day I felt I had held the sky in my hands".[25] Maradona scored his first goal in the Primera División against Marplatense team San Lorenzo on 14 November 1976, two weeks after turning 16.[26] Maradona spent five years at Argentinos Juniors, from 1976 to 1981, scoring 115 goals in 167 appearances before his US$ 4 million transfer to Boca Juniors.[27] Maradona received offers to join other clubs, including River Plate who offered to make him the club's best paid player.[28] Nevertheless, Maradona expressed his will to be transferred to Boca Juniors, the team he always wanted to play for.[29]

Maradona signed a contract with Boca Juniors on 20 February 1981. He made his debut two days later against Talleres de Córdoba, scoring twice in the club's 4-1 win. On 10 April, Maradona played his first Superclásico against River Plate at La Bombonera. Boca defeated River 3-0 with Maradona scoring a goal after dribbling past Tarantini and Fillol.[30] Despite the distrustful relationship between Maradona and Boca Juniors manager, Silvio Marzolini,[31] Boca had a successful season, winning the league title after securing a point against Racing Club.[32] That would be the only title won by Maradona in the Argentine domestic league.After the 1982 World Cup, in June, Maradona was transferred to FC Barcelona in Spain for a then world record fee of £5m ($7.6m).[35] In 1983, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona and Maradona won the Copa del Rey (Spain's annual national cup competition), beating Real Madrid, and the Spanish Super Cup, beating Athletic Bilbao. On 26 June 1983, Barcelona defeated Real Madrid on the road in the world's biggest club game, El Clásico, a match where Maradona scored and became the first Barcelona player to be applauded by arch rival Real Madrid fans.[36] Maradona dribbled past Madrid goalkeeper Agustín, and as he approached the empty goal he stopped just as Madrid defender Juan José came sliding in a desperate attempt to block the shot and ended up crashing into the post, before Maradona slotted the ball into the net.[37] The manner of the goal led to many inside the stadium start applauding: only Ronaldinho, in November 2005, has since been granted such an ovation as a Barcelona player from Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu.[36] Due to illness and injury as well as controversial incidents on the field, Maradona had a difficult tenure in Barcelona.[38] First a bout of hepatitis, then a broken ankle in a La Liga game at the Camp Nou in September 1983 caused by an ill-timed tackle by Athletic Bilbao's Andoni Goikoetxea threatened to jeopardize Maradona's career, but after treatment and therapy it was possible for him to be back on the pitch after a recovery period of three months.[24]


Athletic Bilbao defender Andoni Goikoetxea, dubbed "The butcher from Bilbao", was involved in two controversial incidents with Maradona
The end of the 1983–84 season included a violent and chaotic fight Maradona was directly involved in at the 1984 Copa del Rey final at the Santiago Bernabéu against Athletic Bilbao.[39] After receiving another rough tackle by Goikoetxea which wounded his leg, being taunted with xenophobic insults throughout the match by Bilbao fans, and being provoked by Bilbao's Miguel Sola at full time as Barcelona lost 1–0, Maradona snapped.[39] He aggressively got up, stood inches from Sola's face and the two exchanged words. This started a chain reaction of emotional reactions from both teams. Using expletives, Sola mimicked a gesture from the crowd towards Maradona by using a xenophobic term.[40] Maradona then headbutted Sola, elbowed another Bilbao player in the face, and kneed another player in the head, knocking him out cold.[39] The Bilbao squad surrounded Maradona to exact some retribution with Goikoetxea connecting with a high kick to his chest, before the rest of the Barcelona squad joined in to help Maradona; and from this point on the Barcelona and Bilbao players brawled on the field with Maradona in the center of the action, kicking and punching anyone in a Bilbao shirt.[39]

The mass brawl was played out in front of the Spanish King Juan Carlos and an audience of 100,000 fans inside the stadium, and more than half of Spain watching on television.[41] Sixty people were injured; and this incident effectively sealed Maradona's transfer out of the club in what was his last game in a Barcelona shirt.[40] One Barcelona executive stated: "When I saw those scenes of Maradona fighting and the chaos that followed I realized we couldn't go any further with him."[41] Maradona got into frequent disputes with Barcelona FC executives, especially club president Josep Lluís Núñez, culminating with a demand to be transferred out of Camp Nou in 1984. During his two injury-hit seasons at Barcelona, Maradona scored 38 goals in 58 games.[42] Maradona transferred to Napoli in Italy's Serie A for another world record fee, £6.9m ($10.48m).[11
