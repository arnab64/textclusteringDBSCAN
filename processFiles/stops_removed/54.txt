flood overflow water submerges land usually dry european union eu floods directive defines flood covering water land normally covered water sense flowing water word may also applied inflow tide 

flooding may occur overflow water water bodies river lake water overtops breaks levees resulting water escaping usual boundaries may occur due accumulation rainwater saturated ground areal flood size lake body water vary seasonal changes precipitation snow melt changes size unlikely considered significant unless flood property drown domestic animals
