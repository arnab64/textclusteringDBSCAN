technology viewed activity forms changes culture additionally technology application math science arts benefit life known modern example rise communication technology lessened barriers human interaction result helped spawn new subcultures rise cyberculture basis development internet computer technology enhances culture creative way technology also help facilitate political oppression war via tools guns cultural activity technology predates science engineering formalize aspects technological endeavorthe distinction science engineering technology always clear science reasoned investigation study natural phenomena aimed discovering enduring principles among elements phenomenal world employing formal techniques scientific method technologies usually exclusively products science satisfy requirements utility usability safety 

engineering goaloriented process designing making tools systems exploit natural phenomena practical human means often always using results techniques science development technology may draw upon many fields knowledge including scientific engineering mathematical linguistic historical knowledge achieve practical result 

technology often consequence science engineering — although technology human activity precedes two fields example science might study flow electrons electrical conductors using alreadyexisting tools knowledge newfound knowledge may used engineers create new tools machines semiconductors computers forms advanced technology sense scientists engineers may considered technologists three fields often considered one purposes research reference 

exact relations science technology particular debated scientists historians policymakers late th century part debate inform funding basic applied science immediate wake world war ii example united states widely considered technology simply applied science fund basic science reap technological results due time articulation philosophy could found explicitly vannevar bush's treatise postwar science policy science—the endless frontier new products new industries jobs require continuous additions knowledge laws nature essential new knowledge obtained basic scientific research lates however view came direct attack leading towards initiatives fund science specific tasks initiatives resisted scientific community issue remains contentious—though analysts resist model technology simply result scientific research
