production wheat produced best results fueling selfsufficiency india along high yielding seeds irrigation facilities enthusiasm farmers mobilised idea agricultural revolution due rise use chemical pesticides fertilizers negative effects soil land land degradationthe well irrigated permanently irrigated area % majority part area dependent rainfall consequently agriculture suffered low level production green revolution possible due adequate water supply irrigation government undertook number minor major multipurpose irrigation projects supply sufficient water cultivable lands dependence farmers rainfall reduce great extents government also made provisions digging canals hand pumps etc adequate water supply going forward government also create enabling mechanisms fuel growth quality seed production public sector spending irrigation rural infrastructure storage postharvest connectivity credit availability key inventions encourage farmers invest newer technologies returns would betterfamines india frequent period due faulty distribution food farmers receive true value labour majority population get enough food malnutrition starvation huge problemdue traditional agricultural practices low productivity feed growing population often food grains imported drained away scarce foreign reserves thought increased production due green revolution government maintain buffer stock india achieve selfsufficiency selfreliability 

agriculture basically subsistence therefore less amount agricultural product offered sale market hence need felt encourage farmer increase production offer greater portion products sale market new methods agriculture increased yield rice wheat reduced india's dependence food imports
