steven sasson engineer eastman kodak invented built first electronic camera using chargecoupled device image sensor earlier ones used camera tube later ones digitized signal early uses mainly military scientific followed medical news applications mid late digital cameras became common among consumers mids digital cameras largely replaced film cameras higherend cell phones integrated digital camera beginning almost smartphones integrated digital camerathe two major types digital image sensor ccd cmos ccd sensor one amplifier pixels pixel cmos activepixel sensor amplifier compared ccds cmos sensors use less power cameras small sensor use backsideilluminated cmos bsicmos sensor overall final image quality dependent image processing capability camera sensor typethe resolution digital camera often limited image sensor turns light discrete signals brighter image given point sensor larger value read pixel depending physical structure sensor color filter array may used requires demosaicing recreate fullcolor image number pixels sensor determines camera's pixel count typical sensor pixel count product number rows number columns example pixel sensor would pixels megapixelsince first digital backs introduced three main methods capturing image based hardware configuration sensor color filters 

singleshot capture systems use either one sensor chip bayer filter mosaic three separate image sensors one primary additive colors red green blue exposed image via beam splitter see threeccd camera 

multishot exposes sensor image sequence three openings lens aperture several methods application multishot technique common originally use single image sensor three filters passed front sensor sequence obtain additive color information another multiple shot method called microscanning method uses single sensor chip bayer filter physically moved sensor focus plane lens construct higher resolution image native resolution chip third version combined two methods without bayer filter chip 

third method called scanning sensor moves across focal plane much like sensor image scanner linear trilinear sensors scanning cameras utilize single line photosensors three lines three colors scanning may accomplished moving sensor example using color cosite sampling rotating whole camera digital rotating line camera offers images high total resolution 

choice method given capture determined largely subject matter usually inappropriate attempt capture subject moves anything singleshot system however higher color fidelity larger file sizes resolutions available multishot scanning backs make attractive commercial photographers working stationary subjects largeformat photographsoriginal research 

improvements singleshot cameras image file processing beginning st century made single shot cameras almost completely dominant even highend commercial photographymost current consumer digital cameras use bayer filter mosaic combination optical antialiasing filter reduce aliasing due reduced sampling different primarycolor images demosaicing algorithm used interpolate color information create full array rgb image data 

cameras use beamsplitter singleshot ccd approach threefilter multishot approach color cosite sampling foveon x sensor use antialiasing filters demosaicing 

firmware camera software raw converter program adobe camera raw interprets raw data sensor obtain full color image rgb color model requires three intensity values pixel one red green blue color models used also require three values per pixel single sensor element cannot simultaneously record three intensities color filter array cfa must used selectively filter particular color pixel 

bayer filter pattern repeating x mosaic pattern light filters green ones opposite corners red blue two positions high proportion green takes advantage properties human visual system determines brightness mostly green far sensitive brightness hue saturation sometimes color filter pattern used often involving two different hues green provides potentially accurate color requires slightly complicated interpolation processcameras digital image sensors smaller typical mm film size smaller field angle view used lens focal length angle view function focal length sensor film size used
