The FDM Data Quality group is aligned to the Firmwide Chief Data Officer, Rob Casper. The CDO's vision is to create an industry-leading data environment in terms of control, cost, and revenue opportunity. The program scope continues to evolve and encompasses cultural, behavioral, procedural and systemic transformation across the full range of data domains. Firmwide & CIB CDO offers a unique perspective into the role of data quality in the financial industry, and partners with a variety of stakeholders across LOBs, Corporate Functions and other teams in the Firmwide Data Management organization. The Chief Data Office offers a unique opportunity to be part of a journey that drives the entire strategy of how we manage data in the future - our key raw material for efficiently managing the business.
Department Description
With exponential year-over-year growth of data generated, strong Data Governance, including Data Quality, is critical to ensure clean, fit-for-purpose data for the firm. The Firmwide & CIB Chief Data Office (CDO) is responsible for defining and implementing the Firmwide Data Quality strategy to ensure fit for purpose data. The Data Quality department is accountable for transforming the entire firm's approach to data quality by establishing clear ownership and accountability for critical data, and implementing effective Reactive, Proactive, and Preventative data quality standards, capabilities and processes.

The Reactive Data Quality team is responsible for defining how the Firm manages Data Quality Issue identification, analysis, and remediation effectively and consistently firmwide. Crucial tasks include daily advisory support for our stakeholders across the firm, the development of new Data Quality Metrics, and evolving the operating models, processes, and tooling to drive adoption and enable implementation of agreed best practices.

Background

The successful candidate will join a team focused on delivering business impact through transformation of Data Quality management:

Of importance in 2020 is the ensuring the successful roll out of a transformative new tool, the Intelligent Data Assistant (IDA). IDA is an artificial intelligence platform that enables end users to report Data Quality issues through an intuitive interface. The team would like to expand the usage of IDA to incorporate additional use cases, such as managing issues that are already opened, and addressing data needs outside of Data Quality. The candidate will be expected to understand the business use cases of Data Management and configure/code them in the AI platform that powers IDA, or support stakeholders in doing so themselves.

Also of significance in 2020 is establishing the Data Content owner as a new role across the Firm. The DCO is a new accountable role that will be tasked, among other things, with ensuring effective Data Quality issue management. The candidate will be expected to drive process and tooling enhancements to accommodate the influx of new DCO users by leading small working groups, documenting necessary updates, and holding action owners accountable.

The candidate will be expected support the team in implementing these two major CTB projects, as well as ensuring adequate governance and management of the existing book of work. Managing the existing book of work includes: serving as an escalation point or advisory service with stakeholders regarding issue management processes; partnering with FDM Tech in managing requirements in JIRA with AGILE project management; and producing metrics (Excel, Qlik or Tableau) for Sr. management on the Data Quality book of work.

This role provides an outstanding opportunity at JPMorgan Chase for the selected candidate to join a high profile team and take a partnership role, working with stakeholders across the CIB, other LOBs and Corporate Functions, to support some of the Bank's most significant change programs.

Key roles and responsibilities:
The successful candidate will support the DQ Team's existing overall book of work:
Develop, enhance and present senior management MIS around Data Quality
Minimize risks of technology releases in Firmwide Data Quality applications through effective change management
Liaise with SMEs across the Firm on DQ issues to facilitate timely resolution of pressing matters, participating in / driving deep dive sessions where necessary
